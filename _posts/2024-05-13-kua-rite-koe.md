Kua rite koe? means: Are you ready.

The tense marker "kua" is a preposed verbal particle which marks the [perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(grammar)) tense. It's often taught as being used for any sentence that in English would use "have" or "has".
- Kua haere au - I have gone.

However, it's commonly used in sentences where the English translation doesn't use have/has, although a literal translation might. "Are you ready" in this example could be translated more literally as "Have you prepared?" or "Have you become ready?"

Kua commonly highlights that an action has been completed or something has changed state as a result of some event.
- Kua mate te hōiho - The horse has died
- Kua ora mai anō te tamaiti - The child is well again
- Kua pai! - It's okay! (a possible answer to someone apologising if there was a problem but things have changed and all is well now)

Kua in a conversation normally relates to events that have happened in the past, but this convention is not a rule about kua which only needs to apply to something changing state or being completed:
- Kua haere tātou! - Let's get going then! (if a group is on the verge of going, but haven't started yet, so kua marks the change in behaviour)
- Kua hoki koe? - Are you going home now? (if someone is leaving work to go home, asking if they have changed state from 'not going home' to 'on my way home'.)
