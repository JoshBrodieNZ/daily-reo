I discussed the prefix "kai-" in an earlier post, so I'm taking this as a prompt to continue discussion kupu wetereo (grammar words).

Speaking of prefixes, the kupu for "prefix" is "pīmua", "kūmua" or "kuhimua". The kupu for suffix is "pīmuri", "kūmuri" or "kuhimuri". We can see the words "mua" and "muri" in here which are the locative nouns for "before" and "after" respectively. The kupu "kū" on its own means "syllable" while "kuhi" means "affix" which is the class of words that prefixes and suffixes belong to.

Speaking of locative nouns, the kupu for "locative noun" is "tūwāhi".
