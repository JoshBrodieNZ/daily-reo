Me haere tāua ki te tina means: Let's (you and I) go for lunch.

A quick weekend post because I'm practicing all day at a one-day wānanga, but got to keep up the habit.

Commands using 'me' communicate a softer suggestion, that something "should" happen.
- Me whakarongo koe ki tōu whaea!
- Me mahi ahau āpōpō. - I had better work tomorrow.

Even though you might use a passive sentence construction, you don't use the passive form of the verb (except the kupu taea)
- Me horoi ngā kākahu [e koe]!- [You] should wash the clothes!
