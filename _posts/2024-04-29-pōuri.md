Pōuri means: Sad.

Pōuri is the stative most commonly used for 'sad'. (One thing I'm curious about and suspect but am unsure of is whether Pōuri is related to 'pō uriuri' - the intensely dark or enveloping night) It's also the adjective commonly used for sad/dark/disheartened and a modifier for the same, as well as the noun for darkness/sadness/gloom.

Te reo Māori has many similar cases of homophony, sets of words which are identical in form but have different (although typically related) meanings and sit as different parts of speech. For example 'kai' can mean 'eat' as a verb and also 'food' as a noun, while 'patu' can be a type of weapon or the verb for 'strike/kill'. Verbs and adjectives are especially fluid in this way, to the point that some grammars assert that adjectives are all just verbs. Additionally, outside of the well established homophones which are each different words in their own right, there is freedom to use words of one class as another in general speech.
For example:
- Raumati - (noun) summer
- I raumati - 'spent the summer' (comparable to English's verb 'summer')
- koroua - (noun) elderly man/grandfather
- kua koroua - 'has become old'
