title: Oatemāka (short post)
---

Oatemāka means: Over the top.

This is a kupu hou for me! Kind of a fun extension to the loanword māka/mark. Te Aka also gives it as three words 'oa te māka'. It doesn't prompt any specific grammar nerdery, so I'm not going to force it and leave today's comment at that.
