Tamariki means: Children, or to be young.

Tamariki is the plural form of the word "tamaiti" (child). Generally, the distinction between takitahi (singular) and takitini (plural) nouns is made with the determiner: te/ngā, tōku/ōku, tētahi/ētahi.

However, there are a few words (all terms for people) which have unique forms for singular/plural. Of these, tamaiti/tamariki is even more unique because it's the only one which doesn't involve lengthening the vowel of the third-to-last vowel of the singular form:
- wahine/wāhine (woman)
- tangata/tāngata (person)
- matua/mātua (parent)
- tuahine/tuāhine (sister of a man)
- tuakana/tuākana (elder sibling, same sex)
- teina/tēina (younger sibling, same sex)
- tipuna/tīpuna (grandparent, ancestor)
- tamaiti/tamariki (child)
- whaea/whāea (mother/aunty) - this plural form is only used by some speakers

Tamaiti and tamariki are believed to have emerged from "tama iti" (little child) and "tama ririki" (little children) becoming single words over time.
