Ipurangi means: Internet.

In a [couple]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-24-rorohiko %}) of [earlier posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-25-īmēra %}) I focused on internety, computery words so I'm not going to do that today and will instead wrap up my looking into [nō te]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-20-inapō %}).

Bauer and Harlow's grammars both focus on "nā/nō te mea" for clauses describing cause as in:
- Me pātai atu ki a Hēmi nā te mea kei a ia te mana (You should ask Hēmi because it's his say-so)

In an earlier post on ['mehemea']({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-13-hauora %}) there seems to be a similar construction where the full phrase "me he mea" gradually evolved over time into different forms. These constructions both including kinda idiomatic uses of mea (thing, object, property, one, reason, thingumajig, thingy, thingummy, whatcha-me-call-it, what-d'you-call-it, the one, that thing, whatsit - a word used to replace the name of something).

Bauer's grammar provides some additional detail on using "nā te" for because as in:
- Nā te whatinga o ngā mata, i mutu ai (because of the breaking of the blades, the work ceased)
- Nā te ua mātou i hoki ai hi te kāinga (We returned home because of the rain)

As mentioned in the post a couple of days ago, Bruce Biggs states that "nō te... ai" is required for "because" and Bauer's grammar elaborates on this to say that when a nā phrase precedes a matrix clause, the matrix clause verb requires "ai" unless the tense marker is ka or e.. ana. I'll expand on matrix clauses vs subordinate clauses in a future post.

As I worked through this example, I reread the sentence from Thursday and realised that "nō te" wasn't be used as "because" at all in "he ngongoro nō te ihu o taku tāne" but to attribute the "ngongoro" (snoring) to the "ihu o taku tāne" (nose of my husband) which means that while it prompted an interesting investigation, both of these posts were a wild goose chase based on misreading the original sentence. Further understanding of "nō te", "nā te", "nō te...ai" and "nā/nō te mea" are going to have to go on my list of mysteries to develop a better understanding of over the course of my reo journey.
