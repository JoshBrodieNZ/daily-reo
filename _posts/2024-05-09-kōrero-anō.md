Kōrero anō means: Say that again.

Anō is another example of a particle which typically lives in the [postposed periphery]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /daily-reo/2024-04-24-titiro-mai %}). Its most common use is to roughly mean 'again' or that an event should be repeated.
- Tino paruparu tonu ngā rihi! Horoia anō! - The dishes are still very dirty! Wash them again!

In the example of 'horoia anō' some speakers will make anō undergo 'agreement' with the passive and make it passive as well for "horoia anōtia".
- Anō can also be used to emphasise similarity:
- Kia rite anō ki tō te rangi - To be the same as it is in heaven.

Sometimes it can be used similarly to 'yet' when talking about timeframes:
- Kua oti anō tō tuhinga roa? - Have you finished your essay yet?

This 'yet' form is the manner anō is being used in when negating 'kua' sentences with "kāore anō... kia.."
- Kua hū te wai - The water has boiled.
- Kāore anō te wai kia hū - The water has not yet boiled.
