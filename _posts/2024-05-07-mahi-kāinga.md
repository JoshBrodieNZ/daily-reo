Mahi kāinga means: Homework.

Lots of different words are formed by adding a specifying word after 'mahi'. My mahi kāinga today is to learn a few of them:
- mahi taurangi (algebraic) - algebra
- mahi whika (figure/number/mathematics) - arithmetic
- mahi kōhikohiko (irregular) - casual job
- mahi kaute (counting) - (audit) accounting
- mahi tārake (standing out in the open) - field work
- mahi toi (art) - art, craft.
- mahi māra (garden) - gardening
- mahi pāpāho (broadcast) - media studies.
