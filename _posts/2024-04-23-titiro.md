Titiro means: Look.

Titiro is a good example to use to follow up on [yesterday's rambling]({% post_url 2024-04-22-kōrero-mai %}) about commands/imperatives.

You can use the word on its own as an instruction to someone to look (with what they need to look at being inferred from context.)

If you want to specify in the sentence what they need to look at, you can specify a direct object. Titiro usually takes 'ki' as a joiner so you can give a command such as:
- Titiro ki te papa tuhituhi! - Look at the blackboard!

In this command it's behaving as a transitive verb (it has a direct object). Commands using transitive verbs typically have to take the passive construction, but this is an exception because the verb is marked with 'ki'.

An example of a command marked with 'i' in this way would be using the verb kimi (passive=kimihia) for 'find/search'.
- Kimihia he tikanga! - Find a way!

In this construction the object drops its 'i' and becomes the subject of the sentence. Other examples are:
- Horoia ngā kākahu! - Wash the clothes!
- Whakakoia te māripi - Sharpen the knife!
- Tuhia! - Write (it)!

In the final example, 'tuhi' is being used with an implied object, so even though it's not explicitly mentioned, the verb still takes the passive form.
