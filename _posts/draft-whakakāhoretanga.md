Rather than focusing posts on the daily reo bot, I'm going to start just posting something when I want to deep dive into a topic for my notes. In this case, we've moved to rumaki reo (full immersion) and I've found the thing I improvise most on is negating sentences (by just throwing a casual kaore/ehara at the start of the sentence and calling it a day) which is going to reinforce bad habits, so I'm going to make sure I remember the right way to negate all the sentence types I know.

## 'Ko' Sentences
Ko sentences are discussed in an [earlier post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-06-04-ko-koe-a-runga %}).
They are negated using the negative word "ehara".

"Ko te rangatira a Hōne" (Hōne is the chief) is negated as "Ehara a Hōne i te rangatira" (Hōne is not the chief).

If you wanted to emphasis that Hōne is the chief, rather than someone else, you could put the noun phrases in the opposite order to emphasise Hōne. "Ko Hōne te rangatira". To negate this sentence, you still use "ehara" but retain "ko" also.

"Ehara ko Hōne te rangatira".

## Verbal sentences
Verbal sentences are negated with the negative word "kāore" and by changing the tense marker depending on the tense of the sentence being negated, as in the following sentence (translated using simplified meanings of each tense marker):
- Ka kai au (I will eat)/Kāore au e kai (I will not eat).
- Kei te kai au (I am eating)/Kāore au i te kai (I am not eating).
- E kai ana au (I am eating)/Kāore au e kai ana (I am not eating).
- Kua kai au (I have eaten)/Kāore anō au kia kai (I have not yet eaten)
- I te kai au (I was eating)/Kāore au i te kai (I was not eating) [This is the same as the negation of "kei te"]
- I kai au (I ate)/Kāore au i kai (I did not eat)

### Verbal commands
As a subset of verbal sentences, commands in the form "Haere, e hoa!" (Go, friend!) are negated using the negative word "kaua" as in "Kaua e haere, e hoa!" (Don't go, friend!) or "Kaua hei haere, e hoa!" (same translation, less common particle).

### Verbal suggestions
Phrases suggesting something should happen such as "Me karakia tātou" (we should karakia) can be negated in a couple of ways. One is to dismiss the notion that we *should* perform a specific action, as in "we do not have to karakia" and the other is to explicitly suggest that we should *not* karakia.

To suggest that we should not karakia, we would use the negative word "kaua" as in "Kaua tātou e karakia".

To suggest that "we should karakia" is not true you could use "ehara i te mea me karakia tātou" (it is not the case that we should karakia), or phrases with a similar meaning.

## 'He' Sentences
He sentences are discussed in an [earlier post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-28-karere %}) and expanded on in [another]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-29-kaimahi.md %}).

When the sentence consists of one phrase as in "He taniwha" (there are/exist taniwha) it is negated using the negative word "kāore" as in "Kāore he taniwha" (there are no taniwha [existing]). If the existential phrase has an additional comment detailing place using either "kei" or "i" that comment is introduced by "i" in the negation, so "he taniwha kei toro i tērā ana" (there are taniwha in that cave) becomes "Kāore he taniwha i roto i tērā ana" (there are no taniwha in that cave).

When the nucleus of the predicate is a noun, as in "He rangatira a Hōne" (Hōne is a chief) it is negated using the negative word "ehara" as in "Ehara a Hōne i te rangatira" which is the same as the negation for "Ko te rangatira a Hōne". This sentences uses "te rangatira" instead of "he rangatira" because the phrase is marked with the pūhono (joiner) "i" which cannot precede "he".

When the nucleus of the predicate is an adjective, as in "He makariri rawa te rā" (the day is too cold) it is negated using the negative form of the verbal sentence so we would treat "He makariri rawa te rā" as if it were "Kei te makariri rawa te rā" and negate it using the rules for verbal sentences with "Kāore te rā i te makariri rawa".

When the subject of the sentence is a possessive determiner such as in "He kaputī tāku" (I have a cup of tea) the sentence is negated using the negative word "kāore" and the determiner becomes plural as in "Kāore āku kaputī" (I have no cups of tea).
