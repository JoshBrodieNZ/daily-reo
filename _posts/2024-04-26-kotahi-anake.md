Kotahi anake means: Only one.

Kotahi is the form of the word tahi/one that you typically use when you're saying there is one of something in particular:
- Kotahi te whare kei roto i tēnei rori - There is one house in this street.
- I te wā kotahi - At the one (same) time.

It's also used in this form within larger numbers, such as when specifying that there is one 'hundred' or one 'thousand':
- Kotahi rau - 100
- Kotahi mano e iwa rau e ono tekau mā waru - 1968
- Kotahi rau e toru tekau kiromita te tawhiti i Kirikiriroa ki Ākarana - The distance from Hamilton to Auckland is 130 kilometres.

Numbers are often prefixed by 'toko-' when referring to people or preceded by 'e' if referring to anything else, but kotahi (alongside anything starting with 'tekau') do not take 'e' or 'toko-' (for most speakers, although there are variations in dialects):
- Āku mokopuna tokoiwa - My nine grandchildren.
- Ēnei whare e rua - These two houses.
- Kotahi taku tuahine - I have one sister.

There are some situations where you use simply 'tahi', such as if it is preceded by 'ka'.
- Ka tahi tau au ki reira - I shall be there for one year.

This form is also used when you are explicitly counting, focused on the process of counting:
- Ka tahi, ka rua, ka toru... - One, two, three...

Anake is a postposted particle (like mai) whose purpose is to indicate that the phrase it stands within is is an exhaustive list of the entities being referred to, equivalent to 'only' in English:
- He tōtara anake ngā rākau o tērā uru rākau - Tōtaras are the only trees of that grove, the trees of that grove are all tōtaras.
- Kāore rātou i haere ki Pōneke anake, engari ki ngā tāone katoa o te Upoko-o-te-Ika - They (3 or more) didn't only go to Wellington, but to all the towns of the south end of the North Island.
