Kua pakaru taku rorohiko means: My computer is broken.

Today's rerenga uses the perfect tense [kua]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-05-13-kua-rite-koe %}) and a [stative verb]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-04-27-harikoa %}) to communicate that the computer has changed state and become broken. As noted in the earlier post about statives, we can expand on who did this or how this happened (the agent) with a comment added using the 'i' joiner:
- Kua pakaru taku rorohiko i a koe. - You have broken my computer (My computer has been broken by you)
- Kua pakaru taku rorohiko i te wai. - My computer has been broken by the water.

The agent detailed in the comment after a stative verb can be directly or indirectly responsible for the state.
- Ka mataku te tamaiti i a koe - The child was frightened by you (you are directly responsible)
- Kī tonu te pākete i te wai - The bucket was very full of water (the water is indirectly responsible)
