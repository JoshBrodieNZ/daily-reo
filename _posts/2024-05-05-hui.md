Hui means: Meeting.

I don't have much of interest that comes to mind on this one and I'm trying to keep weekend posts short, so in the interests of keeping the habit going I'll just post a quick example sentence using 'hui' as a verb.
- Tēnā koutou e hoa mā kua hui mai nei i tēnei rā. - (roughly) Greetings my friends (who have/for being) gathered here today.
This common format for a greeting is also seen with sentences like 'kua tae mai nei...', 'kua tau mai nei' to acknowledge that those you're greeting have gathered here.
The tense marker 'kua' here is for the 'perfect aspect' which commonly specifies events which have happened in the past, resulted in a change of state, and often which has present relevance.
