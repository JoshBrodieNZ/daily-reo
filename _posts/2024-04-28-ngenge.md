title: Ngenge (short post)

Ngenge means: Tired.

Lots of what comes to mind about ngenge was already mentioned yesterday in general handling of statives, and it's Sunday so just a quick post to keep the habit up.
There's quite a few 'tired/sleepy/exhausted' words that I hear used.
- Doing evening classes in te reo Māori, "Kei te ngenge ahau" is a really common answer to "Kei te pēhea koe?" to indicate the kind of tiredness you have after a long day.
- Hiamoe/matemoe are more commonly used for the kind of tiredness you get when you're more directly in need of sleep. Ngenge can be used for this but seems to be more versatile than "actually having trouble keeping my eyes open" sleepy.
- Hēmanawa - breathless/winded/exasperated is also often used for "totally wiped out" kind of fatigue.
