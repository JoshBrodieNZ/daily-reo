Īmēra means: Email.

For a quick weekend post, I'm just going to make another little list of kupu to study, related to īmēra:
- pouakauru (inbox) - from pouaka (box) and uru (to enter, go in)
- kape/kapea (cc) - loanword/kupu mino for copy
- kapehuna/kapehunatia (bcc) - kape + huna (hide)
- kaiwhiwhi (recipient)
