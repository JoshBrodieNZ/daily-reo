Hiamo means: To be thrilled, excited or exciting.

Short post today because I'm mƒÅuiui. Hiamo is a new kupu to me! It doesn't read to me like it fits the format of other hia- words, so I suspect it might look similar but not be related. Adding it to the list of kupu I'm keen to learn the whakapapa of. Then I'll need to decide whether I come back to flesh out posts like this or just sometimes post very little.
