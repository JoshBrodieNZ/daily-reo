Mahia te mahi means: Do the work.

"Mahia te mahi" is an example of giving an instruction in the passive construction (or a tohutohu hāngū which I mentioned a bit in another post as well as talking about the passive construction a bit here. It uses the verb 'mahi' in passive form alongside the noun 'mahi'. Other examples of doing the same include:
- Waiatatia te waiata - sing the song
- Kainga tō kai - eat your food (careful to use 'kainga' [eat] instead of 'kāinga' [home] here)
