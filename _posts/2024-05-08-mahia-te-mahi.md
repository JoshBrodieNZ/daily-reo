Mahia te mahi means: Do the work.

"Mahia te mahi" is an example of giving an instruction in the passive construction (or a tohutohu hāngū which I [mentioned a bit in another post]({% post_url daily-reo/2024-04-23-titiro %}) as well as talking about the passive construction a bit [here]({% post_url daily-reo/2024-05-01-hiainu %}). It uses the verb 'mahi' in passive form alongside the noun 'mahi'. Other examples of doing the same include:
- Waiatatia te waiata - sing the song
- Kainga tō kai - eat your food (careful to use 'kainga' [eat] instead of 'kāinga' [home] here)
