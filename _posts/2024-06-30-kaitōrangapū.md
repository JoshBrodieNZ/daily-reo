Kaitōrangapū means: Politician.

Derived from tōrangapū (politics). I haven't tracked down a good way to segue to anything I want to post about on this one today, so I'm not going to. Posting every day is also a lot, so I'm going to slow that down and only post on days where the daily prompt inspires something interesting.
