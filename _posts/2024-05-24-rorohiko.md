Rorohiko means: Computer.

Instead of focusing on grammar with today's post, I'm going to take rorohiko as a prompt to share and learn an assortment of computery kupu that you may be able to use to describe different parts of your mahi. These are sourced from paekupu.co.nz and the NCSC.
- waehere (code) - This can be used as a tūingoa (noun), tūmahi whiti (transitive verb) or tūāhua (adjective). Some examples are:
  - Ki te tuhi waehere a Josh, ka pakaru te rorohiko - If Josh writes code, the computer crashes/breaks.
  - Kei te waehere au i tēnei wā. Ko Python **te reo papatono** - I'm currently coding. **The programming language** is Python (bonus kupu in that example).
- maiki (incident) - I tāhae **te tuma pakepake arā atu anō¹** i **ngā mōhiohio whaiaro²**. He maiki **raraunga wāwāhi³** tēnei. - The **APT threat actor¹** exfiltrated **personal information²**. This is a **data breach³** incident (lots of bonus kupu labelled with **¹²³**. An argument could be made for swapping the order of subject/object in this sentence because the subject is very long.
