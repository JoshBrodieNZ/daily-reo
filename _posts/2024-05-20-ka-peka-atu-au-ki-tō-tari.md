Ka peka atu au ki tō tari means: I'll pass by your office.

This sentence uses the verbal particle 'ka' which is the most frequent verbal marker in all texts, with a wide range of meanings. At beginner (and even intermediate) levels of reo study, 'ka' is [often considered](https://kupu.maori.nz/sentences/active-sentences) as the tense marker used for future tense or an action that comes next after the previous sentence.
- Ka hoki mai ia. - He will return.
- I muri i te hui, ka hoki mai ia. - After the hui, he returned.

However, grammar textbooks note that 'ka' does not convey any tense, aspect or mood information. It simply marks that the sentence is a reremahi (or verbal sentence). It's a relative tense marker, taking its interpretation from the context of the sentence it's in and grammatically it's default reading is present tense. 
- Ā tērā wiki ka tīmata ngā whakamātautau - The exams will start next week (future tense)
- Ka nui te aroha - lots of love (present tense)
- Nō te tau 1987 ka whakaturetia te reo Māori hei reo mana - In 1987, Māori was made an official language by statute (past tense)

Despite this grammar note, given the common teaching of 'ka' as future tense, I find while studying that if 'ka' is used, the default interpretation is likely to be future tense.

A common use of 'ka' is to introduce a chain of events in a narrative:
- Ka ū a Te Arawa ki Whanga-parāoa ka kitea te ika moana e pae ana i uta; ka ū mai hoki a Tainui ki reira anō, ka tautohetohe ki tā rāua ika, ka mea a Tainui nāna te ika, ka mea a Te Arawa nāna te ika (Grey's Nga Mahi a Nga Tupuna).
- Te Arawa landed at Whanga-parāoa, the sea fish was seen beached there, Tainui also landed there, they quarreled about their fish, Tainui said the fish was theirs, Te Arawa said the fish was theirs.

Similar to this narrative use, 'ka' is often found in the second or later clauses in a series of clauses and acquires its meaning from the earlier clause, further demonstrating its function as a relative verbal marker.
